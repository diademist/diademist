Hi, I’m @diademist
I’m interested in Videogames, yet programming is a nice way to solve complex puzzles, and who does not like puzzles?
I’m currently learning to code better... But it is hard, because there is always something new to learn.
I’m looking to collaborate on any various data related of vidya related stuff. I`m just a capable guy, that`s all. 
How to reach me ... I guess that will be left as a question for the future.
